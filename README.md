# Angular (v5) Exmaple
This project was done while learning Angular (version 5) on OpenClassroom.
The goal is to learn how to :
- Create the structure of an Angular project
- Components and data binding ( String , property, event, two-way binding ...)
- Use a Directive ( ngIf, ngFor, ngStyle, ngClass ...)
- Use Pipes 
- Use a service and dependency injection ( communication between components )
- Use routes and route protection(Router, Redirection, Guards ...)
- Authentification (authentification is static here, you can find Library repository which contains a real authentification with firebase service)
- Use an Observable 
- Create with Forms ( Template, Reactive, ...)
- Interact with httpClient server using Firebase


# Project description
We are dealing with two simple models :
- Device features :
      - add new device ( using Reactive From )
      - list all the devices
      - Save/Get the list of the devices to/from the sever
- User
      - add new user ( Template )
      - list all users ( static list of users)
      
 Also, there is some other features tested in each model.
